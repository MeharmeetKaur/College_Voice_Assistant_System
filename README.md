# College-Voice-Assistant-System-in-Android
The system is build for visually impaired students. The system helps them to know the timetable, syllabus, important notices, assignments,attendance,
etc. The system speaks everything according to thier choice. The application is developed in Android and backend is Firebase. I have used Google's API for speech recognization
and text-to-speech conversion.
